## Purpose
Hangmanateach was inspired by countless hours of of learning (and teaching!) vocabulary with conventional flashcard apps. The efficacy of flashcards can occassionally be overshadowed by their dull nature. Hangmanateach's goal is to remedy this problem. The app allows users to:
1. Create study lists

2. Play hangman with these lists

3. Get quizzed on the words' meaning
